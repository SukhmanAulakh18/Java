Learning Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Welcome to my learning journey in Java programming and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). This repository captures my progress as I dive into each topic and concept, combining theoretical understanding with hands-on practice. Here's how I'm approaching my learning:

Table of Contents

Java Basics:
Understanding the basic syntax, data types, and control structures in Java.
Hands-on practice with simple Java programs.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Delving into OOP principles like classes, objects, and inheritance.
Applying OOP concepts through practical examples.

Data Structures:
Starting with fundamental data structures like arrays, linked lists, and stacks.
Solving related questions to reinforce understanding.

Algorithms:
Studying common algorithms for searching and sorting.
Practicing algorithmic problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.
